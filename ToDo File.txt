- and also use express-session during all this
  - SO that different pages/screens/whatnot can be displayed btwn different users.

- For each user if they are a content creator, store their page information in database (such as their profile image, description, etc.)
- Store the creator's ongoing bids as objects
    * Each bid contains:
        @ creator id
        @ current pot
        @ time remaining
        @ description of event
        @ user who made the last bet (and their profile image)
        @ user who made the largest bet
        @ instructions for type of auction (highest bid is winner, lottery, dutch auction, auction based off popularity etc.)



Interesting Applications:
- people like AWEme and building channels could post on our platform and ask users to say which project to make next and highest bid gets their project made
