# Some instructions for setting up:
* First have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed with its package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

* Run `npm install package.json` to install dependencies correctly.

* Then run `npm start` to start the project (script for `npm start` are found in `package.json`, but keep default for now.)

* Recommendation for developing: use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/): auto-restarts server after changes are made within watched-files of project directory, saves a tonne of time lol

* also if you are installing a package for the project, PLEASE use the --save property so it can save as a dependency in your package file: `npm install --save packagename`
